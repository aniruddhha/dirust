//! src/args.rs  (rename to `src/arg.rs` if your project uses that filename)
//!
//! Purpose:
//!   Define the command-line interface (CLI) for Dirust using `clap`'s derive API.
//!   This struct describes all the flags and positional arguments the binary accepts,
//!   and `Args::parse()` will populate it from `std::env::args()` at runtime.
//!
//! Notes:
//!   - We keep the code explicit and add detailed comments for learning clarity.
//!   - No `anyhow` is used anywhere in the project, per your preference.
