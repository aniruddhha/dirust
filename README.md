# Dirust — Fast, Async Directory Brute-Forcer in Rust

**Dirust** is a high-performance web content discovery tool (a.k.a. “directory buster”) written in Rust. It targets hidden files and directories by probing endpoints from a wordlist with optional extensions, using efficient async I/O and clean, explicit code.

**Use cases:** web directory brute forcing, content discovery, red team/pentest recon, CI-friendly site checks, and rapid HTTP enumeration.

---

## Highlights

- **Async & fast** — Tokio runtime + Reqwest client; bounded concurrency for stable throughput.
- **HEAD with safe fallback** — Tries `HEAD` first for speed, falls back to `GET` on `405`.
- **Extensions fan-out** — `--exts php,html,txt` turns `admin` into `admin.php`, `admin.html`, `admin.txt`, etc.
- **Actionable output** — Prints status code, content length (if available), and redirect `Location` targets.
- **Cross-platform** — Linux (incl. Kali), macOS, Windows, and Raspberry Pi (aarch64/armv7).
- **No root needed** — Pure user-space HTTP(S).
- **Readable codebase** — Clear modules, explicit error handling (no `anyhow`), easy to extend.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Build
cargo build --release

# 2) Run against a target
./target/release/dirust https://example.com/ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

# Add extensions and increase concurrency
./target/release/dirust https://example.com/app/ -w words.txt --exts php,html,txt -c 100

# Force GET (some servers block or alter HEAD)
./target/release/dirust https://example.com/ -w words.txt --get

# Set a custom timeout (seconds)
./target/release/dirust https://example.com/ -w words.txt --timeout 20
```

Show help any time:

```bash
./target/release/dirust --help
```

---

## Local Demo (localhost)

Spin up a tiny site locally and point Dirust at it:

```bash
# Create a few files
mkdir -p /tmp/dirust-site/{admin,secret,api}
printf "admin home"  > /tmp/dirust-site/admin/index.html
printf "top secret"  > /tmp/dirust-site/secret/flag.txt
printf "ok"          > /tmp/dirust-site/api/status
printf "read me"     > /tmp/dirust-site/readme.txt

# Start a simple HTTP server (port 8000)
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory /tmp/dirust-site

# Minimal wordlist
cat > /tmp/words.txt <<'EOF'
admin
admin/
secret
secret/
api
api/
status
readme
readme.txt
flag.txt
EOF

# Run Dirust
./target/release/dirust http://127.0.0.1:8000/ -w /tmp/words.txt --exts html,txt -c 50
```

---

## Features in Detail

- **Directory & file discovery:** Reads a wordlist and probes each path relative to the base URL.
- **Extensions expansion:** Applies a comma-separated list of extensions to each word (normalized to `.ext`).
- **Concurrency control:** A semaphore ensures at most `--concurrency N` requests are in flight.
- **Robust HTTP logic:**
  - **Method:** `HEAD` by default; automatic GET retry on `405 Method Not Allowed`, or always `GET` with `--get`.
  - **Redirect awareness:** Prints `→ Location` when present (e.g., `301/302`).
  - **Interesting status filter:** Prints common “exists/protected” signals (`200/301/302/401/403`).
- **Clear output format:**
  ```
  [<unix_ts>] <status> len=<content_length_or_->_>  <url> [-> <location_if_any>]
  ```

---

## Installation

**Requirements:** recent Rust toolchain (`rustup update` recommended).

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> dirust
cd dirust
cargo build --release
```

Binary output:
- Linux/macOS: `./target/release/dirust`
- Windows: `.	arget
elease\dirust.exe`

Raspberry Pi:
- Build on the Pi directly (recommended), or cross-compile using the appropriate target (`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`) and system linker.

## CLI Summary

```
Usage: dirust [OPTIONS] <BASE>

Arguments:
  <BASE>  Base URL (e.g., https://example.com/ or https://example.com/app/)

Options:
  -w, --wordlist <WORDLIST>         Path to wordlist file (required)
  -c, --concurrency <N>             Requests in flight [default: 50]
      --get                         Use GET instead of HEAD
      --timeout <SECS>              Per-request timeout [default: 10]
      --exts <E1,E2,...>            Extra extensions (e.g., php,html,txt)
  -h, --help                        Print help
  -V, --version                     Print version
```

## Architecture

The project is organized into small, focused modules for clarity and maintainability:

```
src/
  main.rs         # entry point: parse args, build client, run scan
  args.rs         # clap-based CLI definition and helpers
  error.rs        # explicit DirustError enum and conversions
  url.rs          # base URL validation/normalization
  scanner/
    mod.rs        # orchestration: concurrency, task spawning, printing
    wordlist.rs   # file I/O: load and filter wordlist
    targets.rs    # build full URLs from base + words + extensions
    http.rs       # single-request probe; summarize status/headers
    util.rs       # timestamp and status filter helpers
```

Design choices:
- **Explicit error handling:** `DirustError` (no `anyhow`), clear `Result` returns, and full `match` statements for readability.
- **No auto-redirect:** we want to **see** redirect responses and their `Location` targets.
- **Stable concurrency:** acquire semaphore permits **before** spawning tasks to hard-cap active work.
- **Separation of concerns:** wordlist reading, target generation, HTTP probe, and printing are isolated modules.

---

## Performance Tips

- Tune `--concurrency` based on network conditions and target behavior. Watch for server rate-limits and adjust.
- `HEAD` is usually faster; if a server misbehaves on HEAD, use `--get`.
- Increase `--timeout` when probing slow or distant hosts; decrease it for aggressive scans on fast LANs.
- Reuse a single process and a single HTTP client (Dirust does this by design) to benefit from connection pooling.

---

## Roadmap

Planned enhancements (kept intentionally focused and practical):

- `--delay-ms` and retries with jitter (gentler on fragile hosts)
- `--output <file>` (text/JSON) and consistent structured logs
- `--proxy`, `--header`, `--user-agent`, `--cookie`
- Smart 404 detection (baseline + size tolerance) as an optional module
- Depth-limited recursion (`--max-depth`) for directory trees
- VHost mode (brute Host header) as a sibling tool

---

## Compatibility

- **OS:** Linux (incl. Kali), macOS, Windows, Raspberry Pi
- **Network:** HTTP/HTTPS, no root privileges required
- **TLS:** Uses rustls; for custom corporate CAs, consider building with native roots (`rustls-tls-native-roots` feature in Reqwest)

---

## Security & Legal

Only scan systems you **own** or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical. Use Dirust responsibly and comply with local laws and the target’s terms of service.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please keep changes:
- Explicit and easy to read (prefer full `match` over terse shortcuts)
- Modular (one concern per file/module)
- Well-explained in commit messages

Open a PR with a clear description and example commands. Bug reports with repro steps are great.
